**Listed Stable AMD GPU Driver List** <br>
I've faced tons of issues in AMD driver. Like blue screen, dark screen, no display, fps drop, over heating etc. So I have decided to listing a stable driver list, may it help other's to choose the best driver for their devices. 

> Currently using **Adrenalin Edition 23.9.2**

### THE LIST HAS BEEN OUTDATED!
